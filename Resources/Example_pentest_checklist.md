# Example Pentest Report Checklist

> This checklist is based on PCI Audit Requirements.

## Penetration Tester Name/Organizaiton

-[] Contact Information
-[] Credentials/Qualifications of analysts
-[] Is there sufficient evidence that the individuals are organizationally independent from the management of the environment being tested?
-[] Dates the engagement was performed
-[] Date the report was issued

## Executive Summary

-[] Summarizes testing performed
-[] Summarizes results of testing
-[] Summarizes steps for remediation

## Scope

-[] Is the scope clearely documented
-[] How the scope was determined
-[] Is the attack perspective of the engagement clearely defined (internal, external, or both)

## Methodology

-[] Is the methodology clearly stated
-[] Does the methodology reflect industry best practices (OWASP, NIST, etc?)
Narrative

-[] Is there clear documentation of any problems that were encountered during the testing (interference from active proteciton systems, target environment controls blocking or dropping packets, etc)?

## Discovery

-[] Is there a section that documents all identified open network prots/services for the target scope and the originating perspective(external or internal exposure)?

## Results

-[] Is there a clear indication whether retesting is needed, and if so, what specific areas require retesting
